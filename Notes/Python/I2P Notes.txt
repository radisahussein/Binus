Python Intro To Programming Notes

- Maximum length of Identifier = 79 characters

- Order of Precedence = P E D M A S

- Core Data Type = Numbers , Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Files

- for x % 0, always error

- for 0 % x, always 0

- if 3 / 2 = 1.5, 3 // 2 = 1

- the operator "//" removes decimals, only whole value

- intialize array = array[x,y,z]

- initialize list = [x,y,z]

- "True = False" , error, cant assign a value to variable True

- variable of class can be changed by calling

- id of same value variables are the same
    ex = 
    a = 2
    b = 2
    id(a) == id(b) #WILL RETURN True

- id from calling class with same parameters, False

- Eval will run an expression
    ex = 
    a = 2
    print(eval(a * 2)) will return 4

    ex 2 = 
    a = "print(30)"
    eval(a)

    will return 30

- getattr returns a value of an attribute of an object
    ex: 
    class Change:
        def __init__(self,a,b):
            self.z = a + b
    
    obj1 = Change(1,2)
    print(getattr(obj1,z)) --> Will return value of z from obj1 = 3

- setattr sets value of an attribute of an object
    format = setattr(object,name of attribute,value)

- Instantation = Creating an instance of a class

- Child class to keep inheriance of parents init function:
    parent.__init__(self)
    or 
    super().__init__()

- Multiple Inheritance = A class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class

- Hierarchical Inheritance = When more than one child class are created from a single parent class

- Single Level Inheritance = When a child class inherits from only one parent class

- Multilevel Inheritance = Child and Grandchild class relationship
